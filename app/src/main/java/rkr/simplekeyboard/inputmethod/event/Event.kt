/**
 * Class representing a generic input event as handled by Latin IME.
 *
 * This contains information about the origin of the event, but it is generalized and should
 * represent a software keypress, hardware keypress, or d-pad move alike.
 * Very importantly, this does not necessarily result in inputting one character, or even anything
 * at all - it may be a dead key, it may be a partial input, it may be a special key on the
 * keyboard, it may be a cancellation of a keypress (e.g. in a soft keyboard the finger of the
 * user has slid out of the key), etc. It may also be a batch input from a gesture or handwriting
 * for example.
 * The combiner should figure out what to do with this.
